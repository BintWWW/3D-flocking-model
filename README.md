A work done with Xinru Liu

When you make and run the file, you will see lots of birds flying in the sky. Right click and you will see a menu, and you can choose the size of the birds, the closeness of the birds, an appropriate boundary movement parameter, the number of birds, and restart the animation with a chosen parameter (if nothing is chosen, restart at the default position), also there is a quit buttom at the end of the menu. What's more user can control the animation by pressing keyboard: '2', '4', '6', '8' for moving camera down, left, right, or up. '5' to pause or resume the animation, '7', '9' to slow down or speed up the animation.
